# Website Design Overview

Welcome to the project repository for our website design. This README provides an overview of our Figma model, including links to our design pages, insights into the design stages, and instructions for viewing the prototype.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on creating a seamless, user-friendly, and visually appealing website. Our design was inspired by the clean and intuitive style of **iCloud**, with a focus on simplicity, accessibility, and modern aesthetics. The design process, from initial concepts to final revisions, is documented within the linked Figma project.

## Project Structure and Design Stages

Our design project is structured across two primary pages within the Figma link:
[text](../../../../../../Downloads/README.md)
### Page 1: Initial Design Concept

- **Description**: This page showcases the first design concept we created for the website. It served as an exploration of our initial ideas for layout, color scheme, and typography. This draft allowed us to experiment and gather feedback on the core visual elements before refining the concept further.
- **Goal**: To present the initial layout and stylistic ideas, setting a baselin
e for further refinements based on user and team feedback.

### Page 2: Finalized Design and Prototype

- **Description**: This page contains the final design that was chosen based on insights gained from the initial draft. It includes polished layouts, refined color schemes, and typography adjustments. A fully clickable prototype is also included, simulating user navigation and interactions to give a realistic view of the website experience.
- **Goal**: To showcase the completed, user-ready design that aligns with our project goals and enhances user experience.

## How to Use the Prototype

To view the interactive prototype in Figma:

1. Click on the link provided above to open the Figma project.
2. Select the "Prototype" tab in Figmaâ€™s top right corner.
3. Navigate through the design by interacting with clickable elements, which simulate user actions and flows on the final website.
